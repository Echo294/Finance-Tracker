# Finance-Tracker
Small finance tracker that stores your inputs.
Starts with a menu, where you can add any income and any expense.
You can show your balance and exit the program.
Upon exiting the programming, it saves your inputs as a finance.txt file.
When you run the program, it accesses the finance.txt file and loads your previous inputs.
You MUST exit via the exit function in the program for it to save. If you close it by re-running or clicking X, it will not save.
